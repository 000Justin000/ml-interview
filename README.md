# Machine learning interview

This repository covers how to prepare for machine learning interviews, mainly
in the format of questions & answers. Asides from machine learning knowledge,
other crucial aspects include:

* [Explain your resume](#explain-your-resume)
* [SQL](#sql)

## Explain your resume

Your resume should specify interesting ML projects you got involved in the past,
and **quantitatively** show your contribution. Consider the following comparison:

> Trained a machine learning system

vs.

> Trained a deep vision system (SqueezeNet) that has 1/30 model size, 1/3 training
> time, 1/5 inference time, and 2x faster convergence compared with traditional
> ConvNet (e.g., ResNet)

We all can tell which one is gonna catch interviewer's eyeballs and better show
case your ability.

In the interview, be sure to explain what you've done well. Spend some time going
over your resume before the interview.


## SQL

Although you don't have to be a SQL expert for most machine learning positions,
the interviews might ask you some SQL related questions so it helps to refresh
your memory beforehand. Some good SQL resources are:

* [W3schools SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
* [SQLZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/)
